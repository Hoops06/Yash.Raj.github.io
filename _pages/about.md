Hi, I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Dartmouth College, focused on mechanistic interpretability, neuro - symbolic AI, and world models.
I’m currently a Research Assistant in the Minds, Machine and Society Lab, working with GPT 2 Small 124M to study superposition through activation probing, sparse auto encoders, and feature visualization, and developing ways to measure how concepts are distributed and shared across neurons and layers.
Before Dartmouth, I interned at Amazon, the Indian Space Research Organisation, and India’s Department of Telecommunications, where I worked on telemetry forecasting, network optimization, and computer vision plus swarm intelligence for multi drone deployment.
When I’m not in the lab, you’ll probably find me playing soccer, skiing, long distance running[ training for a Half Ironman :)], reading books, making music on guitar and piano, or experimenting in the kitchen.
